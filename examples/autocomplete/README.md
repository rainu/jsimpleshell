Auto Complete
============

Auto completion is an aid for the user. It can help the user to speed up his work with the shell. 
The user can tab through the commands and can save a lot of time if he have to enter a file-path
for example.

But pay attantion: the is only an aid! The user dont have to use it and auto complete can't prevent
wrong user inputs!

If you want to implement you own auto complete type you have to implements the _CandidatesChooser_
interface or extens from the _AbstractCandidatesChooser_.
