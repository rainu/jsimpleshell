{"name":"Jsimpleshell","tagline":"A framework for setting up a powerful shell as cli in java.","body":"## 1) What is JSimpleShell?\r\n\r\nJSimpleShell is a java library that allows you to implement easily a shell environment. This shell can be used such like the bash shell in linux systems: You can execute commands; jump through the history; navigate with the arrow-keys; and many more... And the best: it is system independent! That means you can use this functions also on windows systems as well as linux systems.\r\n\r\nThis is the perfect solution if you dont't have much time or no desire to develop a beautiful grafical user interface. You can very simple define a command - just one annotation is enough!\r\n\r\n### 1.1) License\r\n\r\nOf curse JSimpleShell is open-source! This library is distributed under the [BSD License (3-Clause)](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).\r\n\r\n## 2) Integration\r\n\r\n### 2.1) Maven\r\n\r\nJSimpleShell is deployed on [maven-central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|jsimpleshell). That means that you can integrate it easily into your maven project. Just one dependency is enough:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n\t<groupId>de.raysha.lib</groupId>\r\n\t<artifactId>jsimpleshell</artifactId>\r\n\t<version>2.2</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2.2) Shell-Builder\r\n\r\nLet us starts with a plain shell. To create a shell instance you have to use the _ShellBuilder_. With this builder you can build a _main shell_ or a _sub shell_. The following code starts an plain shell. This plain shell contains all default commands such like the command for listing all available commands.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport java.io.IOException;\r\n\r\nimport de.raysha.lib.jsimpleshell.Shell;\r\nimport de.raysha.lib.jsimpleshell.ShellBuilder;\r\n\r\npublic class Example {\r\n\r\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\r\n\t\tShell shell = ShellBuilder.shell(\"MyShell\").build();\r\n\t\tshell.commandLoop();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the _ShellBuilder_ you can configure your shell. You can add handlers (see Handler section); define the style of prompt and many more. Look at the _ShellBuilder_ functions for more useful functions.\r\n\r\nThe _commandLoop_ method starts the input loop. This loop will be leave if the user leave the current shell. By default it happens if the user enter _exit_. \r\n\r\n### 2.3) Handler\r\n\r\nThere are two general types of handler:\r\n* main handler\r\n* aux handler\r\n\r\nThe _main handler_ are __only__ in the current shell available! If this shell starts a sub shell, this main handler is not available in there! However an _aux handler_ will be __shared__ with all following sub shells. If a shell starts a sub shell, this aux handler will be available!\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nIf you want to implement a command that is everywhere available you should use a _aux handler_ which contains this command. \r\n\r\nFor all the following handler-types you must know which kind of handlers they are (aux or main?). After you know it you have to add it to your shell - via _ShellBuilder_ or directely to the shell:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\r\nShell shell = ShellBuilder.shell(\"MyShell\")\r\n\t\t\t\t.addHandler(new MyMainHandler()) //adds a main handler\r\n\t\t\t\t.addAuxHandler(new MyAuxHandler()) //adds an aux handler\r\n\t\t\t.build();\r\n\r\n//adds an aux handler where all contains commands have the prefix \"!\"\r\n//that means the user must enter the ! followed by the command-name\r\nshell.addAuxHandler(new OtherAuxHandler(), \"!\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne handler can be quite more than one type. For example: One handler can contains commands (command handler) but can also be an Input-/Ouput- Converter. Thus it is possible to have one huge class that manage all things - but you should do it only if you have realy little time :)\r\n\r\n#### 2.3.1) Command(-Handler)\r\n\r\nA command-handler is a class that contains methods wich are annotated with the __Command__-Annotation. All methods which have these annotation are commands. Methods without these annotation will be ignored by the shell! \r\n\r\n##### 2.3.1.1) Command-Annotation\r\n\r\n##### 2.3.1.1) Param-Annotation\r\n\r\n#### 2.3.2) Access-Manager\r\n\r\n#### 2.3.3) Command execution hooks\r\n\r\n#### 2.3.4) Message-Resolver\r\n\r\n#### 2.3.5) Candidates-Chooser\r\n\r\n#### 2.3.6) Converter\r\n\r\n### 2.4) Dependency injection\r\n\r\n### 2.5) Input and Output\r\n\r\n## 3) Usage\r\n\r\n### 3.1) Help\r\n\r\n### 3.2) Parameter\r\n\r\n### 3.3) Auto completion\r\n\r\n### 3.4) Sub-Shells\r\n\r\n### 3.5) Variables\r\n\r\n### 3.6) Macros\r\n\r\n### 3.7) Language\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
